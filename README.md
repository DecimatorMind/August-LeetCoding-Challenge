# August-LeetCoding-Challenge
LeetCoding Challenge August

# Important
This repository does not contain solution for all the answers. Since every day a new question is added which must be solved but to the extent i have learnt CPP, the solutions provided will be the better and faster but not for every question, so they are not in this repo.

Since this was my first Leetcode Challenge, i hope to do more questions in the upcoming Challenges.

# Info
This repository contains solutions for the August LeetCoding Questions.
There are total of 8 questions here in this repository from the Leetcode August Challenge.
The name of the files are the same as the question names.
 
# How To Use
Since leetcode provides in function solutions, you can delete the non required parts and use the solution.
Remove the printing parts and return required statements.
